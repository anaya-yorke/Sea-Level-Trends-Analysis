# Sea Level Trend Analysis

## Hypothesis
Periods with sea levels that are exponentially rising will result in more environmental problems compared to periods with lower sea levels.

## Problem Statement
This project explores the increase in sea levels due to global warming and its impacts on the environment such as habitat loss, and flooding.

## Data Usage
I will use the sea level data trends to examine the rate and pattern of increase. To prove or disprove the hypothesis after analyzing the sea level trends, I will be able to determine if there is a correlation between the sea level and negative environmental impacts such as flooding and habitat loss.
