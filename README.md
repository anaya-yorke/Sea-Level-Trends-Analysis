# Sea Level Trend Analysis

## Hypothesis
Exponentially rising sea levels over the years result in greater environmental problems compared to periods with lower sea levels.

## Problem Statement
This project explores the significant increase in sea levels due to global warming and its impacts on the environment, focusing on coastal erosion, habitat loss, and flooding.

## Data Usage
We will analyze historical sea level data trends to examine the rate and pattern of increase. By statistically analyzing these trends, we aim to understand the correlation between rising sea levels and their environmental consequences, thereby validating or disproving our hypothesis.
